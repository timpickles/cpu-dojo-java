# Java Implementation of a CPU from the CPU Dojo

It has been 4 years since I last ran the CPU Dojo at Unruly. Here is my TDD'd Java implementation.

## Dojo Goals

- To learn how a simple CPU executes a program
- To practice TDD
- To achieve something in less than an hour

See worksheets from [timpickles/cpu-dojo](https://github.com/timpickles/cpu-dojo)
